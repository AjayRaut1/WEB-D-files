I'm only one call away<br>
I'll be there to save the day<br>
Superman got nothing on me<br>
I'm only one call away<br>
<br>
Call me, baby, if you need a friend<br>
I just wanna give you love<br>
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon<br>
Reaching out to you, so take a chance<br>
<br>
No matter where you go<br>
Know you're not alone<br>
<br>
I'm only one call away<br>
I'll be there to save the day<br>
Superman got nothing on me<br>
I'm only one call away<br>
<br>
Come along with me and don't be scared<br>
I just wanna set you free<br>
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon<br>
You and me can make it anywhere<br>
But for now, we can stay here for a while<br>
'Cause you know, I just wanna see you smile<br>
<br>
No matter where you go<br>
You know you're not alone<br>
<br>
I'm only one call away<br>
I'll be there to save the day<br>
Superman got nothing on me<br>
I'm only one call away<br>
<br>
And when you're weak I'll be strong<br>
I'm gonna keep holding on<br>
Now don't you worry, it won't be long<br>
Darling, and when you feel like hope is gone<br>
Just run into my arms<br>
<br>
I'm only one call away<br>
I'll be there to save the day<br>
Superman got nothing on me<br>
I'm only one, I'm only one call away<br>
I'll be there to save the day<br>
Superman got nothing on me<br>
I'm only one call away<br>
<br>
I'm only one call away
